	Abstract = {Many developments have taken place within dataflow programming
	languages in the past decade. In particular, there has been a great deal of activity and
	advancement in the field of dataflow visual programming languages. The motivation for
	this article is to review the content of these recent developments and how they came
	about. It is supported by an initial review of dataflow programming in the 1970s and
	1980s that led to current topics of research. It then discusses how dataflow
	programming evolved toward a hybrid von Neumann dataflow formulation, and
	adopted a more coarse-grained approach. Recent trends toward dataflow visual
	programming languages are then discussed with reference to key graphical dataflow
	languages and their development environments. Finally, the article details four key
	open topics in dataflow programming languages.},
