    abstract = {Many developments have taken place within dataflow programming
    languages in the past decade. In particular, there has been a great deal of activity and
    advancement in the field of dataflow visual programming languages. The motivation for
    this article is to review the content of these recent developments and how they came
    about. It is supported by an initial review of dataflow programming in the 1970s and
    1980s that led to current topics of research. It then discusses how dataflow
    programming evolved toward a hybrid von Neumann dataflow formulation, and
    adopted a more coarse-grained approach. Recent trends toward dataflow visual
    programming languages are then discussed with reference to key graphical dataflow
    languages and their development environments. Finally, the article details four key
    open topics in dataflow programming languages.},
